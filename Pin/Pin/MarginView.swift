/**
* Private UIView used when creating layout margins
*
* Funky KVO is being used in order to track when the view
* that the margin is applied to is removed from the screen
* when this occurs, we want to make sure that we remove the
* margin view as well so we don't pollute the parent view
*
* considerations:: The margin view must be a sibling of the
* view that it is being used for. This is enforced in the Pin
* methods already but should be noted.
*
* This class could also fail if the subviews are removed
* from screen for any reason. If this is needed, then the
* views must be configured again when they are added back
* as subviews by using the Pin methods
